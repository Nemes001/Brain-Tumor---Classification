# Brain-Tumor---Classification
This repository contains the first part of a larger project on brain tumor analysis. The classification stage is complete, where MRI scans are classified into tumor types using three different deep learning models: - Model1: LSTM-only - Model2: CBAM-only - Model3: Hybrid model combining LSTM and CBAM outputs
